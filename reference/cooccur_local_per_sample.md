# Per-sample local co-occurrence summary

Run \[cooccur_local()\] for one (cluster_x, cluster_y) pair on each
sample and summarize the per-cell scores at the sample level. Output is
a tidy data.frame suitable for group comparison.

## Usage

``` r
cooccur_local_per_sample(
  obj,
  sample_key,
  group_key,
  cluster_key,
  cluster_x,
  cluster_y,
  patient_key = NULL,
  unit = c("image", "patient"),
  neighbors.k = 20,
  radius = 30,
  maxnsteps = 1,
  summarize = c("mean", "q90", "pos_rate", "log2_oe")
)
```

## Arguments

- obj:

  A Seurat object, a list of Seurat objects, or a data.frame.

- sample_key, group_key, cluster_key, patient_key:

  Sample / group / cluster / patient column names. See
  \[build_sample_design()\].

- cluster_x:

  First cluster of interest.

- cluster_y:

  Second cluster of interest.

- unit:

  "image" or "patient" (averaged across images of the same patient).

- neighbors.k:

  Number of neighbors.

- radius:

  Radius for neighborhood.

- maxnsteps:

  Maximum number of diffusion steps. Each step computes \`s \<- (A + I)
  D^-1 s\` from the previous step; diffusion stops early once the
  kurtosis of the scores decreases by less than 3 between steps (checked
  after step 3). \`0\` returns the raw 0/1 indicator. Versions \<=
  0.99.1 always performed a single step regardless of \`maxnsteps\`.

- summarize:

  Character vector of summary statistics to compute: "mean", "q90" (90th
  percentile), "pos_rate" (fraction of cells with score \> 0), and / or
  "log2_oe": log2 of the number of \`cluster_x\`- \`cluster_y\` pairs
  within \`radius\` of each cell, summed over cells, over its
  expectation under label permutation (see \[cooccur_local_oe()\]).
  \`log2_oe\` is adjusted for the abundance of the two cell types and
  for cell density and is the recommended summary for group comparison;
  "mean" is unchanged by the (mass-conserving) diffusion and grows with
  abundance.

## Value

A data.frame with one row per sample carrying the requested summary
statistics, plus \`n_cells\`, \`n_i\` and \`n_j\` (cells of
\`cluster_x\` / \`cluster_y\`).

## Caution

The local score has no permutation null, so its sample-level summaries
increase with the abundance of \`cluster_x\` and \`cluster_y\`. When the
two groups differ in cell-type composition, check \`n_i\` / \`n_j\` (or
adjust for them with \`covariates\` in \[compare_groups()\]) before
interpreting a group difference as a change in co-localization.
