COHALU is an R package for analyzing spatial co-occurrence and
neighborhood interactions in spatial transcriptomics data. It quantifies
whether cell types sit together more (or less) often than expected by
chance, maps where they meet, **compares these scores between patient
groups** with statistics that treat the patient as the unit of analysis,
and (experimentally) measures co-localization **directly from transcript
coordinates** without cell segmentation.

## Features

**Single-sample analysis**

- Simulate spatial layouts with a planted interaction: `generate_sim()`
- Neighborhood enrichment with a label-permutation null:
  `nhood_enrichment()` returns `log2_oe` = log2(observed / expected), centred
  on the shuffles (effect size, 0 without interaction for any cell number),
  and a within-sample test per pair with max-T family-wise adjustment
  (`padj`); `plot_nhood_heatmap()` shows both. Directional statistics
  (`contact`, `dominance`; row = centre cell type) tell "A is surrounded by B"
  apart from "B is surrounded by A", which the symmetric pair-level O/E cannot
- Radius-based co-occurrence ratio: `calc_co_occurrence_for_radius()` /
  `compute_co_occurrence_ratio()`
- Local co-localization: `cooccur_local_oe()` counts A-B pairs around each
  cell, divides by their exact expectation under label permutation and
  smooths with a Gaussian kernel (abundance-adjusted local log2 O/E, optional
  permutation hotspots, O(n k)); the original diffusion sCLS is kept as
  `cooccur_local()`
- Connected interaction spots: `search_interaction_spot()`

**Multi-sample / disease-group comparison**

- Per-image scores for Seurat objects, lists of Seurat objects or plain
  tables: `nhood_enrichment_per_sample()`, `cooccur_ratio_per_sample()`,
  `cooccur_local_per_sample()`, `interaction_spot_per_sample()`;
  `summarize_by_patient()` averages images within patients
- `compare_groups()`: Wilcoxon (exact for small samples), Welch's *t*,
  linear mixed model with the patient as a random intercept
  (`value ~ group + covariates + (1 | patient)`; `lme4`, Satterthwaite df via
  `lmerTest`),
  patient-blocked permutation, and paired designs such as pre- vs
  post-treatment (`method = "signrank"`, within-patient permutation);
  warns on pseudoreplication
- `associate_continuous()`: association with a continuous clinical
  variable (CRP, disease activity, age) with the patient as the unit
  (Spearman, linear model with covariates, linear mixed model with a random
  patient intercept, permutation)
- Plots: `plot_group_delta_heatmap()`, `plot_pair_boxplot()`,
  `plot_volcano_groups()`

**Segmentation-free analysis of transcript coordinates (experimental)**

- `read_xenium_transcripts()`, `bin_transcripts()`
- Model-free cross pair correlation of gene sets: `pcf_cross()`,
  `pcf_matrix()`; the relative version is the transcript-level
  counterpart of `log2_oe`
- Random-feature log-Gaussian Cox process factor model after Gundersen,
  Zhang & Engelhardt (AISTATS 2021): `fit_spatial_rff()`,
  `rff_pair_correlation()`; `rff_fields()` returns the fitted latent
  fields (cellularity and factors) per cell, transcript or any point;
  residual factors beyond known structure with `rff_offset()` +
  `fit_spatial_rff(offset = , ard = )`, tested by `rff_factor_test()`
- `colocalization_per_sample()` feeds `compare_groups()`
- Unsupervised, gene-level: `colocalization_gene_matrix()` (gene x gene
  log2 O/E of transcript pairs within a radius), `colocalization_modules()`
  (co-localizing gene modules), `module_enrichment()` (any pathways or
  marker lists) and `module_enrichr()` (enrichR)

## How COHALU fits with related tools

Spatial transcriptomics now has excellent tools for discovering structure
directly from the data. COHALU is designed to sit next to them and
focuses on one question: **how strongly do two defined cell populations or
gene programmes co-localize, at which distance, and does this differ between
groups of patients?**

| Tool | Primary focus |
|---|---|
| [FICTURE](https://github.com/seqscope/ficture) (Si *et al.*, *Nat Methods* 2024) | Segmentation-free inference of spatial factors at submicron, pixel-level resolution with a multilayer Dirichlet model; scales to billions of transcripts |
| [punkst](https://github.com/Yichen-Si/punkst) | Scalable toolkit implementing the FICTURE pixel-level factor pipeline and preparing results for visualization |
| [MultiScale_ComplementMacrophage](https://github.com/fanzhanglab/MultiScale_ComplementMacrophage) (Guo *et al.*, in submission) | Spatial neighbourhood-based regression of gene-level associations (Gaussian-kernel neighbourhood exposure, adjusted for self expression and cell density) to define complement-associated niches in RA synovium |
| **COHALU** | Calibrated co-localization between labelled populations (cells, transcripts or factors) and **patient-level comparison across groups** |

What COHALU adds:

- **A calibrated effect size.** Every score is observed / expected under
  label permutation with positions fixed (`log2_oe`, relative pair
  correlation). It is verified on negative controls to stay at zero for any
  number of cell types, cell abundance, image size or cellularity, so values
  can be compared between samples.
- **Distance as an explicit axis.** `pcf_matrix()` returns co-localization as
  a curve over distance for all pairs at once (FFT; 45 pairs over a whole Xenium section in
  about 1.5 minutes), so short-range contact and tissue-scale compartments are
  separated.
- **Where, not only whether.** `cooccur_local_oe()` maps local O/E and
  permutation hotspots for any pair.
- **Case-control and paired designs.** `compare_groups()` treats the patient
  as the unit (exact Wilcoxon, mixed models, blocked permutation, signed-rank
  and sign-flip for pre / post treatment), with power guidance and a
  pseudoreplication warning.
- **Cells, transcripts or factors as input.** The same statistics run on
  segmented cell types, on marker transcripts without segmentation, or on
  any labelled points, for example pixel-level factors from FICTURE / punkst:

  ```r
  # px: pixel-level factor output with coordinates and the top factor
  b <- bin_transcripts(px, bin_size = 4, x_col = "X", y_col = "Y", gene_col = "K1")
  pcf_matrix(b, list(F1 = "1", F2 = "2", F3 = "3"), r_max = 100)
  ```

- **A generative model when needed.** `fit_spatial_rff()` fits a
  random-feature log-Gaussian Cox process (Gundersen, Zhang & Engelhardt,
  AISTATS 2021) that learns spatial length scales and separates cellularity
  from composition.

## Validation

Every module is checked on simulated positive controls (a planted
interaction or group difference) and negative controls (nothing planted),
repeated over many tissues or studies.

*Neighbourhood enrichment on 500 random tissues (100 per number of cell
types): log2 O/E stays at 0 (grey: before centring on the shuffles), each
pair gives 5% false positives, and the max-T adjusted `padj` keeps the
chance of any false pair at or below 5% for 3 to 25 cell types (mean and
95% CI).*

| Check | Setting | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Neighbourhood enrichment, negative control | random tissues, 3–25 cell types (even or 1–30% abundance) | log2 O/E 95% CI includes 0; per-pair false positives ≈ 5%; any pair with `padj` < 0.05 in ≤ 6% of tissues (BH: up to 12%) |
| Neighbourhood enrichment, directional (`contact`, `dominance`), negative control | random tissues, 3–10 cell types (3–30% abundance), 100–400 tissues | per ordered pair 3.6–5.1% false positives; any ordered pair with `*_padj` < 0.05 in 3–6% of tissues (95% CI includes 5%) |
| Neighbourhood enrichment, positive control | B placed 5–100 µm from A, 20 tissues per distance | planted pair log2 O/E ≈ 0.3–0.4 up to 20 µm and `padj` < 0.05 in 90–100% of tissues; 95% CI includes 0 from 40 µm |
| Local O/E, negative control | only the abundance of A and B changes (3–24%) | section O/E 95% CI includes 0; ≤ 5% of cells with p < 0.05; no FDR hits in 80 tissues |
| Local O/E, positive control | ring of B around a disc of A | 74% of ring cells are hotspots, 0% far away |
| Group comparison, negative controls | 200 studies each: no difference, or 4× larger images | 3–4.5% false positives (mixed model, patient-level Wilcoxon) |
| Pseudoreplication | images treated as independent | 13.8% false positives vs ≈ 5% with patient-aware tests |
| Segmentation-free | shared niche field / cellularity-only difference | relative g follows the truth; calibrated when only cellularity differs |

| `cooccur_local_oe()`, no / 99 shuffles | 140k cells | 1.4 s / 15 s | 1.6 GB |
| `compare_groups()` | 34 sections × 105 pairs | 0.2 s (signed-rank), 1.7 s (mixed model) | < 0.6 GB |

## Quick start

### 1. Spatial Neighborhood Analysis (SNA)

```r
library(cohalu)
df <- generate_sim(close_ratio = 1, n_types = 15, max_loc = 800, n_cells = 500,
                   test_type = "circle", distance_param = 20, seed = 1234)

res <- nhood_enrichment(df, cluster_key = "cell_type", neighbors.k = 30,
                        n_perms = 100, seed = 1234, n_jobs = 1)
res$log2_oe   # effect size: use this to compare samples
res$padj      # within-sample significance, max-T adjusted over all pairs
plot_nhood_heatmap(res)   # log2 O/E with significance stars
```

### 2. Local co-localization (where do A and B meet?)

```r
rownames(df) <- paste0("cell", seq_len(nrow(df)))
lo <- cooccur_local_oe(df, cluster_x = "cell_type_1", cluster_y = "cell_type_2",
                       radius = 30, n_perms = 99)
attr(lo, "section_log2_oe")   # whole-section effect size
head(lo)                       # per-cell local_log2_oe, p, padj (hotspots)
```

### 3. Comparing patient groups

```r
df_groups <- generate_sim_groups(
  n_samples_per_group = 6, n_images_per_patient = 3,
  group_close_ratio = list(case = 0.8, control = 0.2),
  n_types = 5, n_cells = 400, test_type = "distribute", distance_param = 15
)
per_image <- nhood_enrichment_per_sample(
  df_groups, sample_key = "sample_id", group_key = "group",
  cluster_key = "cell_type", patient_key = "patient",
  neighbors.k = 20, n_perms = 100, n_jobs = 1
)

# images are nested in patients: use a mixed model (or aggregate first
# with summarize_by_patient() and use method = "wilcox")
res <- compare_groups(per_image, value = "log2_oe", method = "lmm",
                      patient_key = "patient", ref_group = "control",
                      symmetric = TRUE)
head(res)
plot_volcano_groups(res, label_top = 5)
```

### 4. Segmentation-free co-localization (experimental)

```r
tx <- read_xenium_transcripts("path/to/xenium_outs", genes = unlist(marker_sets))
b  <- bin_transcripts(tx, bin_size = 4)
pcf_matrix(b, marker_sets, r_max = 100)   # log_g and log_g_rel for every pair

# no gene sets: find co-localizing gene modules, then interpret them
M    <- colocalization_gene_matrix(b, radius = 20, top_n = 300)
mods <- colocalization_modules(M, n_modules = 15)
module_enrichment(mods, my_pathways)      # named list of gene sets
```

The JCI Insight paper below used an earlier version of these methods
(neighbourhood enrichment reported as z-scores, and a random-walk
co-localization score). Since 0.99.3 the package reports log2 O/E with
permutation-based multiple-testing correction and the local O/E; see
